# Math problem generator
this is a math problem generator, it asks you for which operator you want to use and then it will ask you the level(1,2,3 corrisponding to 1,2,3 digits numbers), it will then generate 10 problems with the requested operator. If you are wrong it will print EEE and after 3 tries it will give you the solution. At the end the program will tell you your score out of 10
